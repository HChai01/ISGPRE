We contructed eight datasets in this project. Here's a breakdown of them:
|Dataset|Brief description|IFN system|ISGs|Non-ISGs|ELGs|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|S1|Well-annotated human genes (background)|IFN-α in fibroblast cells|1315|7304|2217|
|S2|Refined dataset with high confidence|IFN-α in fibroblast cells|620|874|0|
|S2'|Training subset of S2|IFN-α in fibroblast cells|496|496|0|
|S2''|Testing subset of S2|IFN-α in fibroblast cells|124|378|0|
|S3|ISGs with low confidence in S1|IFN-α in fibroblast cells|695|0|0|
|S4|IRGs divided from S1|IFN-α in fibroblast cells|0|1006|0|
|S5|ISGs from Interferome|Type I IFNs in all cells|1259|872|0|
|S6|ISGs from Interferome|Type II IFNs in all cells|2229|755|0|
|S7|ISGs from Interferome|Type III IFNs in all cells|33|1683|2217|
|S8|ELGs divided from S1|IFN-α in fibroblast cells|0|0|2217|

Abbreviations: IFNs: interferons; ISGs: interferon stimulated (up-regulated) human genes; non-ISGs, human genes not significantly up-regulated by interferons; IRG: interferon repressed (down-regulated) human genes; ELGs: human genes with limited expression in the IFN-α experiments.
