Here are 395 parametric (`Original_parametric_features.zip`) and 7044 non-parametric features (`Occurrence_of_short_linear_sequence_patterns.zip`) we calcualted in this project.

`List_of_features_for_training(518).txt` highlights 518 features we used for data analyses and machine learning. 

`Features_for_analyses_and_machine_learning(518).zip` compiled feature profiles that can be used to reproduce our analyses and machine learning framework. Please read our preprint at [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.08.463622) for more details.
