Here's our optimal prediction model (`ISGPRE.model.txt`) and its performance evaluated via five-fold cross validation during the training processing. The training  is processed following the guidelines of [DOME-ML](https://dome-ml.org/guidelines). You can run `svm-train -b 1 -t 2 -c 1 -g 0.0135 Optimal_feature_space.txt ISGPRE.model.txt` in the `ISGPRE/Optimal_SVM_model/Five_fold_cross_validation/` folder to reproduce our prediction model.
