Here are the complementary DNA (cDNA) and corresponding protein sequences used in this project.

The mapping source compiled seven different identifiers for genes/proteins including [HGNC](https://www.genenames.org/) ID, [RefSeq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/) gene/protein ID, [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html) transcript/gene ID, [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) gene ID and approved gene symbol.
